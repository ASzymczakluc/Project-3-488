# Project-3-488

This is a very simple synth build. It uses instances of the other file called Sinwave to create sound. 
Within Sinwave, it has timings and a cycle to help amplify sound. 
On Synth, there is a keyboard that you can attach to an actual keyboard or can just use your cursor to control and can have its sound altered by the amount of instances of Sinwave and off of editing the adsr in Sinwave. 
Overall, a very simple implementation of a synth.
